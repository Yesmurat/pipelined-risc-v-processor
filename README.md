# pipelined-risc-v-processor

Implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor.
Current design only supports `lw`, R-type, I-type, and beq instructions.
Currently working to extend the ISA support and implementing advanced techniques into the design...

`riscvtest.txt` and `riscvtest_dmem.txt` are the memory files for Instruction and Data memories.
